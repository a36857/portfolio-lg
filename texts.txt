ISSUES-WEB API
The Issues API was the project of Web Applications Development class. The goal was to implement an issues management service
where someone could manage the issues from their projects. The application has a REST API to interact programmatically with
the projects and their issues, and an UI to interact visually. The application doesn't have authentication mechanisms.

The REST API uses the hypermedia types Collection+JSON (to get a list of resources) and Siren (to get a single resources)
to represent the context resource and standardized the responses to the clients. The Issues API was implemented using 
the ASP.Net Web API and the all the data is stored in the SQL Server database. For the server communicate with the database,
it was used the Entity Framework. The UI was implemented with React and Bootstrap (it was not used the react-route module).


PORTFOLIO
This simple application was an aside project with the goal to list all the projects that I have done with a web component
and to learn MongoDB and Angular. It lists all the projects and shows the details of the selected project.

The Portfolio application is done with the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). Since this one is a very simple
project, I built the stack on my own. The UI uses Bootstrap.
